In this repo, I will be following along with the React course from fullstackopen.com.

I also add some additional things to tinker with what I know already. I will also test some new things that might catch my attention that may not be shown in the course.

LEARNED CONTENT:

Part 1a:
Passing data using props with jsx
Looping through arrays to display its content


Part 1b:
Arrays
Objects
Classes
More on maps when looping through arrays
